# Stock Portfolio App
Displays stock data using YahooFinanceAPI

I have no idea how to use GitHub but apparently its useful?

This project relies on code from various source that I've adapted to include my own additions on top (listview instead, more fields, calculations, prettier, etc). 

This is actually for a VCE Software Development self-directed project that I'm going to use as my SAT. In retrospect, I really should've chosen something that I had a clue how to make, rather than something completely unrelated to what I've learned like this. Ah well. :{

Anyhow,

In conclusion - HELP
