# Stock Portfolio App
Displays stock data using YahooFinanceAPI

I have no idea how to use GitHub but apparently its useful? I also have no idea how to code properly in Visual Basic in terms of fundamentals besides copy/pasting from tons of sources and then trying to somehow fix errors with my random knowledge. This project relies on some example code from a blog by Eric Moreau regarding the YahooFinanceAPI that displayed 4 basic fields to a listbox, which I've since adapted to include my own additions on top (listview instead, more fields, calculations, prettier, etc). This is actually for a VCE Software Development self-directed project that I'm going to use as my SAT. In retrospect, I really should've chosen something that I had a clue how to make, rather than something completely unrelated to what I've learned like this. Ah well.

Anyhow,

In conclusion - HELP
