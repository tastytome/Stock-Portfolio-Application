# Stock Portfolio App
Displays stock data using YahooFinanceAPI

I have no idea how to use GitHub but apparently its useful?
I also have no idea how to code properly in Visual Basic besides copy/pasting from tons of sources and then trying to somehow fix errors.
This project relies on some example code from a blog by Eric Moreau regarding the YahooFinanceAPI, and then I modified it/added my own additions on top.

Anyhow,

in conclusion - HELP
