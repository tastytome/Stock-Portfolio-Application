# Stock Portfolio App

This program allows users to input stock tickers from any exchange (ASX, American) which are output using real-time data to a GUI form in a table with relevant information such as latest price, change, and other averages, as well as total change of all stocks input. Users can then use a sorting form to filter their input stocks by ascending current value via an array. Also included are basic Future/Past Value calculators. I imported packages such as a YahooFinanceAPI and uploaded each update to GitHub while working on this project.














I also have no idea how it actually works anymore ._.
